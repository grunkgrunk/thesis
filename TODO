# TODO for opg.tex

1. [ ] Write the introduction
2. [ ] Add references
3. [ ] Introduce the p-adic numbers
4. [ ] Mention that convergence is unique
5. [ ] Talk about completion with respect to a valuation
6. [ ] Fix the definition of valuation. Right now we have only defined it for fields. This is an issue because we define valuations on things that are not fields
