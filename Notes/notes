Construction of Galois closure and proof that it is finite when 

Let {𝑏1,⋯,𝑏𝑛} be a basis for 𝐾 as an 𝐹-vector space. Each 𝑏𝑖 has an 𝐹-minimal polynomial 𝑃𝑖(𝑋)∈𝐹[𝑋]. Adjoin all roots of all the polynomials 𝑃𝑖. It’s clearly a normal extension of 𝐹, and pretty clearly the smallest normal extension of 𝐹 containing 𝐸

.

(If 𝐸
wasn’t separable over 𝐹 to start with, I don’t know what a Galois closure of 𝐸 over 𝐹 could be.)



Here is another argument. Let K be number field. Then K = Q(a) (by the primitive root theorem) and we can consider the minimal polynomial f for a over Q. Adjoining all the roots of f to Q we get the splitting field for f.
