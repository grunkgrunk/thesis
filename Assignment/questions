Why would the matrix A^*_ij be invertible? We can show that if we can prove that $L_j(u_1, ..., u_t) \neq 0$. As far as is can tell we have $L_j(u_1, ..., u_t) = 0$ if and only if u_1 = ... = u_t = 0. SOLUTION
Apply sigma on an element alpha which is a solution to the norm equation. Then we have
\sigma_j(\alpha) = c_j \exp L_j(v_1, ..., v_t). This number is non-zero so c_j is non zero meaning that \exp L_*(u_1* ....) is non zero. 




Can the ideal I_V be generated by f_1, ..., f_n? (here the f_i are the power series giving rise to the manifold V). This would make it easier to conclude that a curve is on a manifold. We then just need to make sure that f_i(omega_1(X), ..., omega_t(X)) = 0



Not 100% sure that all solutions can be recovered using integral equivalence.





Should we assume that the c in F(x_1, ..., x_m) = 0 is different from 0? It seems to cause problems when this c is 0. 


Why does the norm form have coefficients in Q?



TODO

Read thru the text
Rearrange stuff

Mention that underlying equality of power series does not imply that the equality holds when plugging in numbers. Also, what happens when the power series has multiple variables?



Mention the theorem of baker and address the improvements he made. Figure out how to translate this theorem into a form that looks like the one thue originally showed
    Seems like we only need to assume that f is of two variables and of degree larger than or equal 3, so that f(x, 1) is a separable polynomial (over )



ALL QUESTIONS

- |x|_1 < 1 implies |x|_2 < 1 actually implies that |x|_2 < 1 implies |x|_1 < 1

- Why do we need the existence of a curve?

- In what way does the theorem of baker
