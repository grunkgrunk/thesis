Why would the matrix A^*_ij be invertible? We can show that if we can prove that $L_j(u_1, ..., u_t) \neq 0$. As far as is can tell we have $L_j(u_1, ..., u_t) = 0$ if and only if u_1 = ... = u_t = 0. SOLUTION
Apply sigma on an element alpha which is a solution to the norm equation. Then we have
\sigma_j(\alpha) = c_j \exp L_j(v_1, ..., v_t). This number is non-zero so c_j is non zero meaning that \exp L_*(u_1* ....) is non zero. 




Can the ideal I_V be generated by f_1, ..., f_n? (here the f_i are the power series giving rise to the manifold V). This would make it easier to conclude that a curve is on a manifold. We then just need to make sure that f_i(omega_1(X), ..., omega_t(X)) = 0


Should we assume that the c in F(x_1, ..., x_m) = 0 is different from 0? It seems to cause problems when this c is 0.
